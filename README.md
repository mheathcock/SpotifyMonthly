# Program to make monthly playlists containing Users top Spotify tracks of the past month.

 **Don't forget to edit `#Config` in `main.py` to use your application specific client id/secret.**

### Currently working on
  - Functionality to allow **any** user to use app **without** the need to have their own Spotify Developer App.
  - Functionality started to save each monthly recap into a growing file. This can then be used at the end of the year to sum up and sort Artists by how often they have appeared in the monthly playlists. *(A basic spotify wrap in a way)*
